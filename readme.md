Algorithm-yoga
==============

This is a collection of some fundamental algorithms in Python 2.7.
At the moment around one third of the planned algorithms are implemented.

Currently the following algorithms can be used:

graphs
------
	- Connected Components in an undirected graph
	- Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph
	- Find cycles in a 
	- Generate random directed graph
	- Generate random undirected graph

strings
-------
	- Rabin-Karp pattern mathing
	- Hash function

sorting
-------
	- selection sort (both with and without recursion)
	- insertion sort (both with and without recursion)

miscellaneous
-------------
	- binary search
	- list rotation
	- uniq on lists
